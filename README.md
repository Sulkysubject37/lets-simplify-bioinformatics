# Let's Simplify Bioinformatics

This repository contains the source material for the living book, "Let's Simplify Bioinformatics: A Conceptual, Computational, and Interpretability-First Atlas of Biological Data Science."

## Motivation

Bioinformatics is not inherently difficult—it is poorly explained. This project aims to restore clarity, intuition, and biological meaning to the field by teaching bioinformatics as a mode of structured thinking, not just tool execution.

## Structure

The book is divided into thematic sections, each progressing from conceptual foundations to executable case studies.

-   **Section I — How to Think About Biological Data:** Establishes the conceptual and epistemological foundation for the rest of the book.
-   **Section II — Biological Sequences as Information:** Transforms the mental model of sequences from linear text into spatial, probabilistic, and structural objects.
