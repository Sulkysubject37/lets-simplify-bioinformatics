# Section II — Biological Sequences as Information

**Author:** MD. Arshad

## Section Goal
The primary objective of this section is to transform the reader’s mental model of biological sequences from linear text into spatial, probabilistic, and structural objects.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 5: DNA as Information, Not Text** (Alphabet vs language, Entropy, Redundancy, Evolutionary constraint)
- **Chapter 6: Alignment as Geometry** (Similarity as distance, Scoring as assumptions, Alignment as optimization in space)
- **Chapter 7: Assembly as Graph Construction** (Reads → overlaps → graphs, Ambiguity, Why perfect assembly is often impossible)
- **Chapter 8: Variation as Biological Signal** (Variation ≠ error, Null expectation, Context-dependence of impact)

## Section Summary
Section II has dismantled the "textual" view of biology. By reframing DNA as a physical information carrier (Chapter 5), we moved from characters to signal density. This foundation allowed us to redefine alignment as a geometric search in a metric manifold (Chapter 6) and assembly as a topological reconstruction from fragmented echoes (Chapter 7). Finally, we reframed variation not as an error, but as the high-resolution signal of biological individuality and evolution (Chapter 8). The reader is now equipped to view genomic data as a dynamic, 3D coordinate system rather than a static 1D string.

## Exit Condition
This section is considered successful only if the reader moves beyond the following misconceptions:
1. "DNA is text"
2. "Alignment is matching letters"
3. "Assembly reconstructs the genome"
4. "Variants equal effects"
