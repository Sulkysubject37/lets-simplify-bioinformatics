# Section II — Biological Sequences as Information

**Author:** MD. Arshad

## Section Goal
The primary objective of this section is to transform the reader’s mental model of biological sequences from linear text into spatial, probabilistic, and structural objects.

## Chapters
- **Chapter 5: DNA as Information, Not Text** (Alphabet vs language, Entropy, Redundancy, Evolutionary constraint)
- **Chapter 6: Alignment as Geometry** (Similarity as distance, Scoring as assumptions, Alignment as optimization in space)
- **Chapter 7: Assembly as Graph Construction** (Reads → overlaps → graphs, Ambiguity, Why perfect assembly is often impossible)
- **Chapter 8: Variation as Biological Signal** (Variation ≠ error, Null expectation, Context-dependence of impact)

## Exit Condition
This section is considered successful only if the reader moves beyond the following misconceptions:
1. "DNA is text"
2. "Alignment is matching letters"
3. "Assembly reconstructs the genome"
4. "Variants equal effects"
